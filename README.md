# raptor-chess-interface
Raptor is a cross platform chess interface and pgn viewer for the free internet chess server: [http://www.freechess.org/ FICS].

## Moved from Google Code ##
The Raptor repository has been moved from Google Code (http://code.google.com/p/raptor-chess-interface/) to GitHub.

For now, please consult the documentation on the original site. What did change is the build procedure: check the documentation
for the releases on how to build them.

Large binary files (and their history) have been removed from the repository but otherwise, most files and their history are part of the new repository.

## Fix for MacOSX Yosemite ##
Yosemite requires a recent version of SWT. Release v.99.004 already comes with the latest version in its pre-built Jar.
