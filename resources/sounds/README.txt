You are free to replace sounds in these directories. As long as they are 
named the same you will encounter no issues as long as they are wav files.

**IMPORTANT**
If you add extra sounds to this directory BEWARE. java only supports
a certain number of audio lines being open at one time and for efficiency
all sounds in this directory are always kept open.

Countdown sounds were taken from the THIEF project:
